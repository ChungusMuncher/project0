                        <p>Start by washing the vegetables. You'll probably want to
                            peel the carrot. Cut the carrot and cucumber into matchsticks
                            using a sharp knife. Try to cut around the watery core
                            of the cucumber. For now, we want to try to keep our veg dry.<br>
                            Cut the radishes into fine rounds. Feel free to use as many or as little as
                            you'd like.

                        <h4 class="mt 0 mb-1">2. Salt the veg</h4>
                        <p>Chuck all of that veg into a nice big bowl, and add your two tablespoons
                            of salt. (Don't worry, this will be washed off later. We're just using it to 
                            draw the moisture out of the veg to make it easier to pickle!)<br>
                            Toss the veg in the salt, making sure it's all mixed in well. Set the veg to one side
                            for 30 minutes.

                        <p>While you're waiting with bated breath for your veg to finish salting, you
                            can get on with making the pickling liquid.
                        Add your vinegar, sugar, black pepper, and lime juice to a small saucepan. Bring the vinegar to a boil
                        for around a minute to dissolve the sugar. Set aside to cool.
                         (It doesn't have to be room temperature, just not boiling hot.)

                        <p>After your veg has had some quality time with the salt, be sure to rinse it 
                            under running water to get rid of excess salt. Pat the veg dry with a tea towel,
                            then pour the pickling liquid over the veg. Feel free to transfer it to a jar or 
                            something similar if you're going to be keeping it for a while. <br>
                            If the container is airtight, this pickle can be kept in the fridge for several weeks!

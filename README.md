# Project 0
Welcome to my first CS50 Web project!

I believe all of the criteria has been met, and I've done my best to make the site look as nice as I can. 

For this project, I've built a small site to showcase some recipes. 

## File contents:

#### HTML files:
These contain the webpages for the site. There's one index page, and you can navigate to the other pages using buttons.

#### Static:

##### Style.scss 
This is the sass source code for the website's CSS. All of the criteria described in the project's requirements have been met. 

##### Style.css
This is the actual compiled CSS file that's being used for the webpages. 

##### Pics:
This is a folder containing all of the images used on the site.
